      <SEOSection title="Understanding Velocity: The Foundation of Motion">
        <p>
          Velocity is one of the most fundamental concepts in physics, describing how fast an object moves and in what direction. Whether you&apos;re studying physics, engineering, or simply curious about how things move, understanding velocity is essential. Our Velocity Calculator makes it easy to calculate velocity, distance, or time using the simple formula: <strong>v = d/t</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Velocity differs from speed in that it includes direction. While speed tells you how fast something is moving, velocity tells you both how fast and in which direction. For our calculator, we focus on the magnitude of velocity (speed) in one dimension, making it perfect for solving basic kinematics problems.

      <SEOSection title="How to Use Our Velocity Calculator">
        <p>
          Our Velocity Calculator is designed for simplicity and accuracy. Follow these steps to get your calculation:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Enter Two Values:</strong> Input any two of the three values (distance, time, or velocity)</li>
          <li><strong>Leave One Empty:</strong> Leave the value you want to calculate empty</li>
          <li><strong>Click Calculate:</strong> The calculator will instantly compute the missing value</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The calculator uses the fundamental velocity formula: <strong>Velocity = Distance ÷ Time</strong>
        </p>
      </SEOSection>

      <SEOSection title="Understanding the Velocity Formula">
        <p>
          The velocity formula is one of the most important equations in physics:
        </p>
        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg text-center">
          <p className="font-mono text-lg font-bold">v = d/t</p>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2">Where: v = velocity, d = distance, t = time</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Rearranging the Formula</h3>
        <p>You can rearrange this formula to solve for any variable:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Distance:</strong> d = v × t</li>
          <li><strong>Time:</strong> t = d ÷ v</li>
          <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> v = d ÷ t</li>
        </ul>

      <SEOSection title="Units and Measurements">
        <p>It&apos;s crucial to use consistent units in your calculations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Distance:</strong> meters (m), kilometers (km), miles (mi), feet (ft)</li>
          <li><strong>Time:</strong> seconds (s), minutes (min), hours (h)</li>
          <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> meters per second (m/s), kilometers per hour (km/h), miles per hour (mph)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Tip:</strong> Always convert to consistent units before calculating. For example, if distance is in kilometers and time is in hours, your velocity will be in km/h.

      <SEOSection title="Common Velocity Calculations">
        <h3>Example 1: Car Travel</h3>
        <p>A car travels 150 kilometers in 2 hours. What is its velocity?</p>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <p className="font-mono">v = d/t = 150 km ÷ 2 h = 75 km/h</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Example 2: Running Speed</h3>
        <p>A runner completes a 5-kilometer race in 25 minutes. What is their average velocity?</p>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <p className="font-mono">v = d/t = 5 km ÷ (25/60) h = 12 km/h</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Example 3: Time Calculation</h3>
        <p>How long does it take to travel 300 meters at a velocity of 15 m/s?</p>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <p className="font-mono">t = d/v = 300 m ÷ 15 m/s = 20 s</p>
        </div>
      </SEOSection>

      <SEOSection title="Velocity vs. Speed: Understanding the Difference">
        <p>While often used interchangeably, velocity and speed have distinct meanings:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Speed:</strong> A scalar quantity that only describes how fast something is moving</li>
          <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> A vector quantity that describes both speed and direction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our calculator computes the magnitude of velocity (speed) in one dimension. For more complex motion involving direction changes, you would need vector mathematics.

        <SEOFAQ questions={[
          {
            question: "What&apos;s the difference between velocity and speed?",
            answer: "Speed is a scalar quantity (magnitude only), while velocity is a vector quantity (magnitude and direction). Our calculator computes the magnitude of velocity, which is equivalent to speed in one dimension."
          },
          {
            question: "Can velocity be negative?",
            answer: "Yes, velocity can be negative, which indicates motion in the opposite direction. However, our calculator focuses on the magnitude (absolute value) of velocity."
          },
          {
            question: "What units should I use for velocity calculations?",
            answer: "Use consistent units throughout your calculation. Common combinations include: m/s (meters per second), km/h (kilometers per hour), or mph (miles per hour). Always ensure distance and time units are compatible."
          },
          {
            question: "How do I calculate average velocity?",
            answer: "Average velocity is calculated using the same formula: v = d/t, where d is the total displacement and t is the total time. This gives you the overall rate of motion for the entire journey."
          },
          {
            question: "What if I have acceleration involved?",
            answer: "For motion with constant acceleration, you would use different equations like v = u + at (where u is initial velocity and a is acceleration). Our calculator is for constant velocity (no acceleration) scenarios."
