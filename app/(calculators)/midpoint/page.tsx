      <SEOSection title="How to Use Our Midpoint Calculator">
        <p>
          Getting your answer is straightforward. You just need the coordinates of two distinct points.
        </p>
        <SEOList items={[
          "Enter Point 1: Input the coordinates for your first point into the (x₁, y₁) fields.",
          "Enter Point 2: Input the coordinates for your second point into the (x₂, y₂) fields.",
          "Calculate: Click the 'Calculate' button.",
          "Get Your Result: The calculator will instantly display the midpoint coordinates, along with a clear breakdown of the calculation."

      </SEOSection>

      <SEOSection title="Interpreting Your Results">
        <p>
          The coordinates our <strong>midpoint calculator</strong> provides represent the exact center point between your two input points. This result will be displayed as (x, y) coordinates.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you input points (2, 4) and (8, 10), the calculator will return the midpoint (5, 7). This means the center point is located 5 units along the x-axis and 7 units along the y-axis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The calculator also shows you the individual x and y coordinates separately, making it easy to understand exactly where your midpoint is positioned on the coordinate plane.

        <SEOFAQ questions={[
          {
            question: "What is a midpoint in simple terms?",
            answer: "A midpoint is the exact center of a line segment. It's the point that is an equal distance from both of the segment's endpoints. Imagine a seesaw; the midpoint is the fulcrum where it would be perfectly balanced."
          },
          {
            question: "Can the midpoint have decimal or negative coordinates?",
            answer: "Absolutely. If the endpoint coordinates sum to an odd number, the midpoint will have a decimal. If endpoints are in negative quadrants, the midpoint can have negative coordinates. Our midpoint calculator handles all real numbers."
          },
          {
            question: "What is the difference between the midpoint and the distance?",
            answer: "The midpoint is a point (a location represented by coordinates), while the distance is a scalar value (a single number representing length). You use the midpoint formula to find a location and the distance formula to find a length."
          },
          {
            question: "How is the midpoint related to a perpendicular bisector?",
            answer: "A perpendicular bisector is a line that passes through the midpoint of a segment at a 90-degree angle. Therefore, finding the midpoint is the first step in determining a perpendicular bisector. For a refresher on linear equations, you might find our Standard Form to Slope Intercept Calculator helpful."
          },
          {
            question: "Can I use the midpoint formula for 3D coordinates?",
            answer: "Yes! The concept extends to three dimensions. For two points (x₁, y₁, z₁) and (x₂, y₂, z₂), the midpoint is ((x₁ + x₂)/2, (y₁ + y₂)/2, (z₁ + z₂)/2). You simply average each coordinate separately."
