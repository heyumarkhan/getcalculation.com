      <SEOSection title="Understanding GCF: The Foundation of Number Theory">
        <p>
          The Greatest Common Factor (GCF), also known as the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), is one of the most fundamental concepts in number theory and algebra. Whether you&apos;re simplifying fractions, solving algebraic equations, or working with number theory problems, understanding <strong>GCF</strong> is essential for mathematical success. This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about finding the greatest common factor, from basic concepts to advanced applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          At its core, the GCF of two or more numbers is the largest positive integer that divides each of the numbers without leaving a remainder. Our GCF Calculator at the top of this page makes these calculations instant and accurate, but understanding the underlying principles will help you solve complex mathematical problems and make informed decisions. We&apos;ll explore the mathematical concepts, provide practical examples, and clarify common points of confusion.

      <SEOSection title="Understanding the Euclidean Algorithm">
        <p>
          The Euclidean algorithm is the most efficient method for finding the GCF of two numbers. It works by repeatedly applying the division algorithm:
        </p>
        
        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg text-center my-4">
          <p className="font-mono text-lg font-bold">GCF(a,b) = GCF(b, a mod b)</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Where a mod b is the remainder when a is divided by b.</p>
        
        <h3>Step-by-Step Process:</h3>

          "Start with two numbers, a and b",
          "Calculate the remainder when a is divided by b",
          "Replace a with b and b with the remainder",
          "Repeat until the remainder is 0",
          "The last non-zero remainder is the GCF"

      <SEOSection title="Key Properties of GCF">
        <p>
          The greatest common factor has several important mathematical properties:

      <SEOSection title="Common GCF Scenarios">
        <h3>Simplifying Fractions</h3>
        <p>
          To simplify 24/36, find GCF(24, 36) = 12, then divide both numerator and denominator by 12: 24/36 = 2/3.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Factoring Algebraic Expressions</h3>
        <p>
          To factor 12x + 18y, find GCF(12, 18) = 6, then factor out: 12x + 18y = 6(2x + 3y).
        </p>
        
        <h3>Finding Common Denominators</h3>
        <p>
          To add 1/6 + 1/8, find GCF(6, 8) = 2, then LCM = (6 × 8) / GCF(6, 8) = 48/2 = 24.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Optimizing Ratios</h3>
        <p>
          To find the simplest ratio of 15:25, find GCF(15, 25) = 5, then divide: 15:25 = 3:5.
        </p>
      </SEOSection>

      <SEOSection title="GCF vs. LCM (Least Common Multiple)">
        <p>
          It&apos;s important to understand the relationship between GCF and LCM:
        </p>
        
        <h3>Key Relationship</h3>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
          <p className="font-mono text-center">GCF(a, b) × LCM(a, b) = a × b</p>

      <SEOSection title="Advanced GCF Concepts">
        <h3>Extended Euclidean Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
          The extended Euclidean algorithm not only finds the GCF but also the coefficients x and y in the equation ax + by = GCF(a, b).
        </p>
        
        <h3>Prime Factorization Method</h3>
        <p>
          For small numbers, you can find GCF by comparing prime factorizations and taking the minimum power of each prime.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Binary GCD Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
          For very large numbers, the binary GCD algorithm can be more efficient than the standard Euclidean algorithm.

        <SEOFAQ questions={[
          {
            question: "What is the difference between GCF and LCM?",
            answer: "GCF is the largest number that divides all given numbers, while LCM is the smallest number that all given numbers divide into. They are related by GCF(a,b) × LCM(a,b) = a × b."
          },
          {
            question: "Can the GCF be larger than the smallest number?",
            answer: "No, the GCF cannot be larger than the smallest number in the set, since the GCF must divide all numbers in the set."
          },
          {
            question: "What happens when all numbers are the same?",
            answer: "If all numbers are the same, the GCF equals that number. For example, GCF(5, 5, 5) = 5."
          },
          {
            question: "Can the GCF be 1?",
            answer: "Yes, when numbers are relatively prime (coprime), their GCF is 1. This means they share no common factors other than 1."
          },
          {
            question: "How do you find GCF of more than two numbers?",
            answer: "Find the GCF of the first two numbers, then find the GCF of that result with the third number, and so on. GCF(a,b,c) = GCF(GCF(a,b), c)."
          },
          {
            question: "What is the GCF of 0 and any number?",
            answer: "The GCF of 0 and any number a is |a| (the absolute value of a). This is because any number divides 0, so the largest common divisor is the number itself."
