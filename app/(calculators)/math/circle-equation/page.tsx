      </SEOSection>

      <SEOSection title="Key Properties of Circle Equations">
        <p>
          Circle equations have several important mathematical properties:
        </p>
        
        <h3>Geometric Properties</h3>
        <SEOList items={[
          "All points on the circle are equidistant from the center",
          "The radius is the distance from center to any point on the circle",

          "The circumference is 2πr",
          "The area is πr²"
        ]} />
        
        <h3>Algebraic Properties</h3>
        <SEOList items={[
          "Standard form is easier to identify center and radius",
          "General form is better for algebraic manipulation",
          "Both forms represent the same geometric object",
          "Conversion between forms is straightforward"
        ]} />
        
        <h3>Special Cases</h3>
        <SEOList items={[
          "Unit circle: center at origin, radius 1",
          "Origin circle: center at (0, 0)",
          "Point circle: radius 0 (degenerate case)",
          "Imaginary circle: negative radius squared"
        ]} />
      </SEOSection>

      <SEOSection title="Practical Applications of Circle Equations">
        <p>
          Circle equations are used in numerous real-world scenarios:

        ]} />
      </SEOSection>

      <SEOSection title="Common Circle Equation Scenarios">
        <h3>Given Center and Radius</h3>
        <p>
          When you know the center (h, k) and radius r, use the standard form directly.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Given Three Points</h3>
        <p>
          When you have three points on the circle, use the determinant method to find the center and radius.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Converting Between Forms</h3>
        <p>
          To convert from standard to general form, expand and rearrange. To convert from general to standard form, complete the square.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Finding Intersections</h3>
        <p>
          Circle equations help find intersections with lines, other circles, and conic sections.

      <SEOSection title="Advanced Circle Equation Concepts">
        <h3>Parametric Equations</h3>
        <p>
          Circles can be expressed parametrically: x = h + r cos(θ), y = k + r sin(θ).
        </p>
        
        <h3>Polar Coordinates</h3>
        <p>
          In polar coordinates, circles have simple equations: r = constant (centered at origin).
        </p>
        
        <h3>Complex Plane</h3>
        <p>
          In the complex plane, circles can be represented using complex numbers and their properties.

      <SEOSection title="Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)">
        <SEOFAQ questions={[
          {
            question: "What is the difference between standard form and general form?",
            answer: "Standard form (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r² directly shows the center (h, k) and radius r. General form x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0 is better for algebraic manipulation but requires calculation to find center and radius."
          },
          {
            question: "Can you find a circle from just two points?",
            answer: "No, two points alone do not uniquely determine a circle. You need either the center and radius, or three non-collinear points to define a unique circle."
          },
          {
            question: "What happens if the three points are collinear?",
            answer: "If three points are collinear (lie on the same line), they cannot define a circle. The calculator will show an error message in this case."
          },
          {
            question: "How do you convert from general form to standard form?",
            answer: "Complete the square for both x and y terms. For x² + Dx, add (D/2)². For y² + Ey, add (E/2)². Then rearrange to get the standard form."
          },
          {
            question: "What is a unit circle?",
            answer: "A unit circle is a circle with radius 1, typically centered at the origin (0, 0). It&apos;s fundamental in trigonometry and has the equation x² + y² = 1."
          },
          {
            question: "Can a circle have a negative radius?",
            answer: "No, radius is always non-negative. If the calculation results in a negative radius, it means the given points do not define a valid circle."
