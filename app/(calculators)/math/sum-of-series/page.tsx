      <SEOSection title="How to Use Our Sum of Series Calculator">
        <p>
          Our calculator supports three types of series calculations. Here&apos;s how to use each one:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Arithmetic Series:</strong> Enter the first term, common difference, and number of terms. The calculator will use the formula S = n/2 × (2a + (n-1)d).</li>
          <li><strong>Geometric Series:</strong> Input the first term, common ratio, and number of terms. The calculator applies S = a × (rⁿ - 1) / (r - 1).</li>
          <li><strong>Custom Series:</strong> Enter any sequence of numbers separated by commas, and the calculator will sum them directly.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Each calculation includes detailed step-by-step work, showing exactly how the result was obtained, making it perfect for learning and verification.

      <SEOSection title="Arithmetic Series: Understanding Linear Progressions">
        <p>
          An arithmetic series is the sum of terms in an arithmetic sequence, where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. This type of series is incredibly common in everyday mathematics and real-world applications.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Arithmetic Series Formula</h3>
        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg text-center mb-4">
          <p className="font-mono text-lg font-bold">S = n/2 × (2a + (n-1)d)</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>S</strong> = Sum of the series</li>
          <li><strong>n</strong> = Number of terms</li>
          <li><strong>a</strong> = First term</li>
          <li><strong>d</strong> = Common difference</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Example: Sum of First 10 Odd Numbers</h4>
        <p>Find the sum of the first 10 odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First term (a) = 1</li>
          <li>Common difference (d) = 2</li>
          <li>Number of terms (n) = 10</li>
          <li>Sum = 10/2 × (2(1) + (10-1)(2)) = 5 × (2 + 18) = 5 × 20 = 100</li>
        </ul>
      </SEOSection>

      <SEOSection title="Geometric Series: Understanding Exponential Growth">
        <p>
          A geometric series is the sum of terms in a geometric sequence, where each term after the first is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio. These series are fundamental in understanding exponential growth and decay.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Geometric Series Formula</h3>
        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg text-center mb-4">
          <p className="font-mono text-lg font-bold">S = a × (rⁿ - 1) / (r - 1)</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>S</strong> = Sum of the series</li>
          <li><strong>a</strong> = First term</li>
          <li><strong>r</strong> = Common ratio</li>
          <li><strong>n</strong> = Number of terms</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Example: Sum of Powers of 2</h4>
        <p>Find the sum of 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First term (a) = 1</li>
          <li>Common ratio (r) = 2</li>
          <li>Number of terms (n) = 6</li>
          <li>Sum = 1 × (2⁶ - 1) / (2 - 1) = 1 × (64 - 1) / 1 = 63</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Special Case: r = 1</h4>
        <p>When the common ratio is 1, the formula simplifies to: S = a × n</p>
      </SEOSection>

      <SEOSection title="Custom Series: Handling Any Sequence">
        <p>
          Our calculator also supports custom series, where you can input any sequence of numbers separated by commas. This is particularly useful for:

        <h4>Example: Custom Series</h4>
        <p>Calculate the sum of: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20</p>
        <p>Simply enter &quot;2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20&quot; in the custom series field, and the calculator will return the sum: 77</p>

      </SEOSection>

      <SEOSection title="Advanced Concepts and Limitations">
        <h4>Infinite Series</h4>
        <p>
          While our calculator handles finite series, infinite series (where n approaches infinity) require different approaches and convergence analysis. For infinite geometric series with |r| &lt; 1, the sum formula becomes S = a / (1 - r).
        </p>

        <h4>Convergence and Divergence</h4>
        <p>
          Not all infinite series have finite sums. Understanding convergence is crucial for advanced mathematics, particularly in calculus and analysis.
        </p>

        <h4>Computational Considerations</h4>
        <p>
          For very large numbers of terms, our calculator uses efficient formulas rather than adding terms individually, ensuring accuracy and performance.

          {
            question: "What's the difference between a sequence and a series?",
            answer: "A sequence is an ordered list of numbers (like 1, 3, 5, 7...), while a series is the sum of those numbers (1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16). Our calculator finds the sum of series."

            question: "Can I calculate the sum of an infinite series?",
            answer: "Our calculator is designed for finite series. For infinite series, you need to check convergence first. Only convergent infinite geometric series with |r| &lt; 1 have finite sums."
