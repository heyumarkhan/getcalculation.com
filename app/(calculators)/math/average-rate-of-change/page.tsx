      <SEOSection title="Understanding Average Rate of Change">
        <p>
          The average rate of change is a fundamental concept in calculus that measures how much a function changes 
          between two points. It represents the slope of the secant line connecting these points and is calculated 
          using the formula: (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁).

          {
            question: "What is the difference between average and instantaneous rate of change?",
            answer: "Average rate of change measures the change between two points, while instantaneous rate of change measures the change at a specific point. Average rate uses the slope of a secant line, while instantaneous rate uses the slope of a tangent line."
          },
          {
            question: "Can the average rate of change be negative?",
            answer: "Yes, a negative average rate of change indicates that the function is decreasing between the two points. The y-values are getting smaller as x increases."
          },
          {
            question: "What does a zero average rate of change mean?",
            answer: "A zero average rate of change means there is no change in the y-values between the two points. The function has the same value at both points, creating a horizontal line segment."
          },
          {
            question: "How is average rate of change related to derivatives?",
            answer: "The derivative is the limit of the average rate of change as the two points get closer together. It represents the instantaneous rate of change at a specific point."
          },
          {
            question: "Can I use this calculator for any type of function?",
            answer: "Yes, this calculator works for any function where you can identify two points. It doesn&apos;t matter if the function is linear, quadratic, exponential, or any other type."
