          {
            question: "How do you find the hypotenuse if you know the leg?",
            answer: "Multiply the leg length by √2. For example, if the leg is 5, the hypotenuse is 5√2 ≈ 7.07."

          {
            question: "What is the area of a 45-45-90 triangle?",
            answer: "The area is (leg²) ÷ 2. Since both legs are equal, you can use either leg in the formula."

          {
            question: "Can a 45-45-90 triangle be scalene?",
            answer: "No, a 45-45-90 triangle is always isosceles because it has two equal angles (45°) and therefore two equal sides."
          },
          {
            question: "What is the perimeter of a 45-45-90 triangle?",
            answer: "The perimeter is 2 × leg + hypotenuse. Since hypotenuse = leg × √2, this equals leg × (2 + √2)."
