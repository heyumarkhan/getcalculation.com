        <p>
          The volume of a hemisphere can be calculated using the following formula:
        </p>
        
        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg text-center my-4">
          <p className="font-mono text-xl font-bold">V = (2/3) × π × r³</p>
        </div>

        ]} />
        
        <h3>Formula Derivation</h3>
        <p>
          The hemisphere volume formula is derived from the sphere volume formula. Since a hemisphere is half of a sphere:
        </p>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="font-mono text-center">Sphere Volume = (4/3) × π × r³</p>
          <p className="font-mono text-center">Hemisphere Volume = (1/2) × (4/3) × π × r³</p>
          <p className="font-mono text-center">Hemisphere Volume = (2/3) × π × r³</p>
        </div>
      </SEOSection>

      <SEOSection title="Step-by-Step Calculation Examples">
        <p>
          Let&apos;s work through some examples to understand how the formula is applied:
        </p>
        
        <h3>Example 1: Hemisphere with Radius 5 units</h3>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p><strong>Given:</strong> Radius (r) = 5 units</p>
          <p><strong>Formula:</strong> V = (2/3) × π × r³</p>
          <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Calculate r³ = 5³ = 125</p>
          <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> V = (2/3) × π × 125</p>
          <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> V = (2/3) × 3.14159 × 125</p>
          <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> V = 261.799 cubic units</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Example 2: Hemisphere with Radius 3.5 units</h3>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p><strong>Given:</strong> Radius (r) = 3.5 units</p>

      <SEOSection title="Understanding Hemisphere Geometry">
        <p>
          Before calculating volume, it&apos;s important to understand what makes a hemisphere:
        </p>
        
        <h3>Key Properties of a Hemisphere</h3>
        <SEOList items={[
          "A hemisphere is half of a sphere",
          "It has one flat circular face (the base)",
          "It has one curved surface",
          "The radius is the same for both the sphere and hemisphere",
          "The diameter of the flat face equals the diameter of the original sphere"
        ]} />
        
        <h3>Visualizing a Hemisphere</h3>
        <p>
          Imagine cutting a perfect sphere in half through its center. Each half is a hemisphere. The flat surface is a circle with the same radius as the original sphere, and the curved surface maintains the same curvature as the original sphere.
        </p>
      </SEOSection>

      <SEOSection title="Units and Measurement Considerations">
        <p>
          When calculating hemisphere volume, it&apos;s crucial to use consistent units:
        </p>
        
        <h3>Common Units for Volume</h3>
        <SEOList items={[
          "Cubic meters (m³) - for large objects",
          "Cubic centimeters (cm³) - for small objects",
          "Cubic inches (in³) - in imperial system",
          "Cubic feet (ft³) - for larger measurements",
          "Liters (L) - for liquid volumes (1 L = 1000 cm³)"
        ]} />
        
        <h3>Unit Conversion Example</h3>
        <p>
          If you have a hemisphere with radius 10 cm:
        </p>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p>V = (2/3) × π × (10 cm)³</p>
          <p>V = (2/3) × π × 1000 cm³</p>
          <p>V = 2094.4 cm³</p>
          <p>V = 2.094 L (since 1000 cm³ = 1 L)</p>
        </div>
      </SEOSection>

      <SEOSection title="Practical Applications of Hemisphere Volume">
        <p>
          Hemisphere volume calculations are used in numerous real-world scenarios:

      <SEOSection title="Relationship Between Hemisphere and Sphere">
        <p>
          Understanding the relationship between hemisphere and sphere volumes is fundamental:
        </p>
        
        <h3>Volume Relationships</h3>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p><strong>Sphere Volume:</strong> V_sphere = (4/3) × π × r³</p>
          <p><strong>Hemisphere Volume:</strong> V_hemisphere = (2/3) × π × r³</p>
          <p><strong>Relationship:</strong> V_hemisphere = (1/2) × V_sphere</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Surface Area Considerations</h3>
        <p>
          While we focus on volume here, it&apos;s worth noting that hemisphere surface area includes:
        </p>
        <SEOList items={[
          "Curved surface area: 2πr² (half of sphere&apos;s surface area)",
          "Flat circular base area: πr²",
          "Total surface area: 3πr²"

      <SEOSection title="Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them">
        <p>
          Here are some common errors when calculating hemisphere volume and how to avoid them:
        </p>
        
        <h3>Mistake 1: Using Diameter Instead of Radius</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Error:</strong> Using diameter in the formula instead of radius
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Always use the radius (half of the diameter) in the formula
        </p>
        
        <h3>Mistake 2: Forgetting the (2/3) Factor</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Error:</strong> Using the full sphere volume formula (4/3) instead of hemisphere (2/3)
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Remember that hemisphere volume is half of sphere volume
        </p>
        
        <h3>Mistake 3: Incorrect Unit Handling</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Error:</strong> Mixing units or not converting properly
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Always use consistent units throughout the calculation
        </p>
      </SEOSection>

      <SEOSection title="Advanced Concepts and Extensions">
        <h3>Hollow Hemispheres</h3>
        <p>
          For hollow hemispheres (with thickness), you need to calculate the volume of the outer hemisphere and subtract the volume of the inner hemisphere:
        </p>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p>V_hollow = (2/3) × π × (R³ - r³)</p>
          <p>Where R is outer radius and r is inner radius</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Hemisphere in Different Coordinate Systems</h3>
        <p>
          In calculus and advanced mathematics, hemisphere volume can be calculated using integration methods, which provide the same result as the geometric formula.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Approximations and Precision</h3>
        <p>
          For practical purposes, π is often approximated as 3.14 or 22/7, but for precise calculations, use more decimal places of π.

      <SEOSection title="Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)">
        <SEOFAQ questions={[
          {
            question: "What is the difference between a hemisphere and a sphere?",
            answer: "A hemisphere is exactly half of a sphere. While a sphere is a complete 3D object with only curved surfaces, a hemisphere has one flat circular face (the base) and one curved surface. The volume of a hemisphere is half the volume of a sphere with the same radius."
          },
          {
            question: "Why is the hemisphere volume formula (2/3)πr³ instead of (4/3)πr³?",
            answer: "The hemisphere volume formula is (2/3)πr³ because a hemisphere is half of a sphere. The sphere volume formula is (4/3)πr³, so hemisphere volume = (1/2) × (4/3)πr³ = (2/3)πr³."
          },
          {
            question: "Can I use the same formula for any hemisphere size?",
            answer: "Yes, the formula V = (2/3)πr³ works for any hemisphere size, as long as you use the correct radius. The formula is universal and doesn't depend on the specific dimensions of the hemisphere."
          },
          {
            question: "How do I find the radius if I only know the diameter?",
            answer: "The radius is half of the diameter. If you have a diameter of 10 units, the radius is 5 units. Always use the radius in the volume formula, not the diameter."
          },
          {
            question: "What units should I use for the radius and volume?",
            answer: "Use consistent units throughout your calculation. If you measure the radius in centimeters, the volume will be in cubic centimeters. If you measure in meters, the volume will be in cubic meters. The units for volume are always the cube of the units used for the radius."
          },
          {
            question: "How accurate is the hemisphere volume calculation?",
            answer: "The calculation is mathematically exact when using the precise value of π. In practice, the accuracy depends on the precision of your radius measurement and the number of decimal places you use for π. Our calculator uses high-precision calculations for maximum accuracy."
          }
