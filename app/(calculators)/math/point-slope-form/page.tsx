      <SEOSection title="Common Point Slope Form Scenarios">
        <h3>Finding Line Equations</h3>
        <p>
          When you know a point and slope, point slope form gives you the equation directly.

        <h3>Parallel Lines</h3>
        <p>
          Parallel lines have the same slope but different points. Use the same slope with a different point.

      <SEOSection title="Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)">
        <SEOFAQ questions={[
          {
            question: "What is the difference between point slope form and slope intercept form?",
            answer: "Point slope form uses a specific point and slope (y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)), while slope intercept form uses the slope and y-intercept (y = mx + b). Point slope is better when you know a point, slope intercept is better when you know the y-intercept."
          },
          {
            question: "Can you use point slope form for vertical lines?",
            answer: "No, vertical lines have undefined slope, so point slope form doesn&apos;t apply. Vertical lines have the form x = constant, where the constant is the x-coordinate of any point on the line."
          },
          {
            question: "How do you find the slope if you only have two points?",
            answer: "Use the slope formula: m = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁). Once you have the slope, you can use either point with point slope form."
          },
          {
            question: "What if the slope is zero?",
            answer: "When slope is zero, you have a horizontal line. The point slope form becomes y - y₁ = 0, which simplifies to y = y₁ (a horizontal line)."
          },
          {
            question: "How do you convert point slope form to standard form?",
            answer: "Start with y - y₁ = m(x - x₁), expand to y - y₁ = mx - mx₁, then rearrange to mx - y = mx₁ - y₁. This gives you the standard form Ax + By = C."
          },
          {
            question: "Can point slope form have fractions?",
            answer: "Yes, point slope form can have fractional slopes and coordinates. You can convert to standard form to eliminate fractions if needed."
