      <SEOSection title="The Semicircle Area Formula">
        <p>
          The area of a semicircle is exactly half the area of a full circle. Since the area of a circle is π × r², the semicircle area formula is:
        </p>
        
        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg text-center mb-4">
          <p className="font-mono text-lg font-bold">Area = (1/2) × π × r²</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>r</strong> = radius of the semicircle</li>
          <li><strong>π</strong> ≈ 3.14159 (pi)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Example: Semicircle with Radius 5</h4>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
          <p><strong>Given:</strong> Radius (r) = 5</p>
          <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Area = (1/2) × π × r²</p>
          <p><strong>Calculation:</strong> Area = (1/2) × π × 5²</p>
          <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Area = (1/2) × π × 25</p>
          <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Area = (1/2) × 78.54</p>
          <p><strong>Result:</strong> Area = 39.27 square units</p>
        </div>
      </SEOSection>

      <SEOSection title="Working with Different Input Types">
        <h3>From Radius</h3>
        <p>When you have the radius, the calculation is direct:</p>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
          <p><strong>Area = (1/2) × π × r²</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h3>From Diameter</h3>
        <p>When you have the diameter, first find the radius:</p>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
          <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> r = d ÷ 2</p>
          <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Area = (1/2) × π × r²</p>
        </div>

        <h3>From Circumference</h3>
        <p>When you have the circumference, work backwards to find the radius:</p>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
          <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> d = C ÷ π</p>
          <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> r = d ÷ 2</p>
          <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Area = (1/2) × π × r²</p>

          {
            question: "What&apos;s the difference between a semicircle and a half circle?",
            answer: "A semicircle and a half circle are the same thing - both refer to exactly half of a circle. The terms are used interchangeably in mathematics."
          },
          {
            question: "Can I use the same formula for a quarter circle?",
            answer: "No, a quarter circle would use the formula: Area = (1/4) × π × r². The fraction changes based on what portion of the circle you&apos;re calculating."
          },
          {
            question: "What if I only know the area and need to find the radius?",
            answer: "You can work backwards: r = √(2 × Area ÷ π). This is useful when you know the semicircle area and need to find other measurements."
          },
          {
            question: "Does the semicircle area formula work for any unit of measurement?",
            answer: "Yes, as long as you use the same units consistently. If radius is in meters, area will be in square meters; if radius is in inches, area will be in square inches."
          },
          {
            question: "What&apos;s the relationship between semicircle area and perimeter?",
            answer: "The area and perimeter are related through the radius, but there&apos;s no direct formula. You need to calculate them separately using their respective formulas."
          },
          {
            question: "Can I use this calculator for sectors of circles?",
            answer: "This calculator is specifically for semicircles (180° sectors). For other sector angles, you&apos;d need a different formula: Area = (θ/360°) × π × r², where θ is the central angle."
