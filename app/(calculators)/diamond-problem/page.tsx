      <SEOSection title="Interpreting the Results">
        <p>
          The two numbers provided by the <strong>diamond problem solver</strong> are more than just a simple answer; they are the key to unlocking the next step in your algebraic problem, which is typically factoring a quadratic equation.
        </p>
        <p>
          A quadratic equation is expressed in the form ax² + bx + c = 0. The diamond problem is most commonly used in a factoring method known as the "AC method," where you need to find two numbers that multiply to equal a · c (the product) and add up to equal b (the sum).
        </p>
        <SEOList items={[
          "<strong>The 'Product' (Bottom Number):</strong> This is the result of multiplying the 'a' coefficient and the 'c' constant from your quadratic equation (a · c).",
          "<strong>The 'Sum' (Top Number):</strong> This is the 'b' coefficient from your quadratic equation.",
          "<strong>The 'Side Numbers' (Your Results):</strong> These are the two magic numbers that satisfy the conditions. Let's call them m and n."
        ]} />
        <p>
          Once you have these two numbers (m and n), you can rewrite the middle term (bx) of your quadratic equation as the sum of these two numbers (mx + nx). The equation then becomes ax² + mx + nx + c = 0. From here, you can use the "factoring by grouping" method to find the final factors of the equation.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, when our <strong>diamond solver</strong> gives you two numbers, it's handing you the exact components needed to break down a complex trinomial into simpler, factorable groups.

      <SEOSection title="The Formula Behind the Diamond Solver">
        <p>
          While the visual of a diamond is helpful, the core of this tool is a solid mathematical foundation based on a system of two equations. Understanding this formula empowers you to solve the problem manually and appreciate how our <strong>diamond problem solver</strong> works.
        </p>
        <p>Let's define our variables:</p>
        <SEOList items={[
          "Let S be the given sum (the top number).",
          "Let P be the given product (the bottom number).",
          "Let x and y be the two unknown numbers we need to find (the side numbers)."
        ]} />
        <p>From this, we can establish a system of two simple equations:</p>
        <SEOList items={[
          "x + y = S (The sum of the two numbers is S)",
          "x · y = P (The product of the two numbers is P)"
        ]} ordered={true} />
        <p>To solve for x and y, we can use the substitution method. First, we isolate one variable in the first equation. Let's solve for y:</p>
        <div className="space-y-3">
          <p className="bg-gray-100 px-3 py-2 rounded font-mono text-sm">y = S - x</p>
          <p>Now, we substitute this expression for y into the second equation:</p>
          <p className="bg-gray-100 px-3 py-2 rounded font-mono text-sm">x · (S - x) = P</p>
          <p>Next, we distribute the x on the left side of the equation:</p>
          <p className="bg-gray-100 px-3 py-2 rounded font-mono text-sm">Sx - x² = P</p>
          <p>To solve this, we want to rearrange it into the standard form of a quadratic equation, ax² + bx + c = 0. We can achieve this by moving all terms to one side:</p>
          <p className="bg-gray-100 px-3 py-2 rounded font-mono text-sm font-bold">x² - Sx + P = 0</p>
          <p>To find the value of x, we can use the powerful quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a. In our equation (x² - Sx + P = 0), the coefficients are a = 1, b = -S, and c = P. Substituting these into the quadratic formula gives us the formula our <strong>diamond problem solver</strong> uses:</p>
          <p className="bg-gray-100 px-3 py-2 rounded font-mono text-sm font-bold">x = (S ± √(S² - 4P)) / 2</p>
        </div>
        <p>The 'plus-minus' symbol (±) indicates that there are two possible solutions for x. These two solutions are, in fact, our two desired numbers, x and y.</p>

      <SEOSection title="Worked Example: Solving the Diamond Problem Manually">
        <p>
          To truly understand the process, let's walk through an example. Imagine you are asked to find two numbers whose sum is 11 and whose product is 30.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Method 1: The Intuitive Approach (Trial and Error)</h3>

          "<strong>Identify the correct pair:</strong> The pair (5, 6) adds up to 11."
        ]} ordered={true} />
        <p>Therefore, the two numbers are 5 and 6.</p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Method 2: The Formulaic Approach</h3>
        <p>Let's use the formula we derived, x² - Sx + P = 0.</p>
        <SEOList items={[
          "<strong>Substitute S=11 and P=30 into the equation:</strong> x² - 11x + 30 = 0",
